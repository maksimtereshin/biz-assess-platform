## ADR-001: Monorepo Structure with Shared Types

**Status**: Implemented ✅
**Date**: Early Development Phase

### Decision
Organize the codebase as a monorepo with three packages:
- `backend/`: NestJS API server
- `frontend/`: React SPA
- `shared/`: Common TypeScript types

### Context
Need to maintain type safety between frontend and backend while avoiding code duplication and type drift.

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Shared interfaces prevent API contract mismatches
- **Development Speed**: Single repository for all code changes
- **Consistency**: Unified development workflow and tooling
- **Dependency Management**: npm workspaces for shared dependencies

### Consequences
✅ **Positive**:
- Strong type safety between client and server
- Faster development with unified tooling
- No type drift between frontend and backend

⚠️ **Negative**:
- Slightly more complex build process
- All developers need to understand full stack

## ADR-002: Session-Based Routing Architecture

**Status**: Implemented ✅
**Date**: Recent Implementation

### Decision
Implement session-based URLs with unique identifiers:
- `/express/:sessionId` for Express surveys
- `/full/:sessionId` for Full surveys
- `/:surveyType/:sessionId/results` for results

### Context
Users needed ability to bookmark, share, and resume surveys. Previous implementation used generic routes without session tracking.

### Rationale
- **User Experience**: Users can bookmark and return to specific surveys
- **Session Recovery**: Resume incomplete assessments
- **Data Integrity**: Each session has unique data space
- **Analytics**: Track individual user journeys

### Consequences
✅ **Positive**:
- Improved user experience with reliable session recovery
- Better analytics and user journey tracking
- Shareable survey links
- Clear data separation between sessions

⚠️ **Negative**:
- More complex routing logic
- Session management overhead

### Rationale
- **ACID Compliance**: Reliable transactions for financial data
- **Complex Queries**: Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
- **JSON Support**: Flexible survey data storage
- **Scalability**: Proven performance at scale
- **TypeORM Integration**: Type-safe database operations

### Consequences
✅ **Positive**:
- Reliable data consistency
- Powerful query capabilities
- Excellent tooling and monitoring
- Type-safe database operations

⚠️ **Negative**:
- Higher resource usage than NoSQL alternatives
- More complex for simple CRUD operations

## ADR-007: Docker-Based Development Environment

**Status**: Implemented ✅
**Date**: Development Workflow

### Decision
Use Docker Compose for local development with hot reloading.

### Context
Need consistent development environment across different machines and operating systems.

### Rationale
- **Environment Consistency**: Same setup for all developers
- **Easy Onboarding**: Single command to start development
- **Service Orchestration**: Database, backend, frontend coordination
- **Production Parity**: Development matches production environment

### Consequences
✅ **Positive**:
