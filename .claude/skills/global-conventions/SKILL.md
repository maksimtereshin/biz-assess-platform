name: Global Conventions
description: Follow project-wide development conventions including consistent project structure, clear documentation, version control best practices, environment configuration, dependency management, code review processes, and modular architecture following Open/Closed Principle. Use this skill when organizing project files and directories, writing README files, creating commit messages, managing dependencies, setting up environment variables, implementing feature flags, or designing modular system boundaries. Use when working with configuration files (.env, package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml), documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), version control operations, or architectural decisions about how to structure and organize code across the entire project.

# Global Conventions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on project-wide development conventions and best practices that apply across the entire codebase, including architectural principles like SRP and OCP.

## When to use this skill

- When organizing or restructuring project files and directories
- When writing or updating documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/)
- When creating git commit messages or pull/merge request descriptions
- When managing dependencies in package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod
- When setting up or using environment variables and configuration files (.env, config.yml)
- When implementing feature flags for incomplete features
- When designing modular architecture with clear system boundaries (OCP principle)
- When organizing code into modules with single responsibilities (SRP)
- When establishing or following code review processes
- When defining testing requirements or test coverage expectations
- When maintaining changelogs or release notes
- When making architectural decisions about how code should be structured
- When working with version control operations (git, commits, branches)
