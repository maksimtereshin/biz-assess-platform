# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Initialize a new spec folder for fixing report generation functionality. The user wants to fix issues with report generation in their business assessment platform. Create the spec folder structure and return the path to the dated spec folder (YYYY-MM-DD-spec-name) you've created.

Context: This is a business assessment platform with a Telegram bot that conducts surveys and generates PDF reports. The report generation feature appears to have issues that need to be fixed.
